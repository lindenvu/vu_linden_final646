Practice with jQuery Selectors and Commands
In this assignment you will practice working with jQuery selectors and commands. You will use a basic version of the Vecta Corp website to select elements and then apply jQuery commands to those elements. To get started, open the vectacorp project folder within Brackets and complete the following steps using jQuery only:

General
1.	Find the jQuery library, download it, and reference it from within the Vecta Corp. web page. Do not use the CDN, use the downloadable library.
2.	Create a document ready function within an embedded script block in your web page. This is where you’ll write your code.

The Headings
3.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a CSS solid, black, 1px border to them.
4.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a color of #CC1C0D to them.
5.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a padding of 3px to the top and bottom and 20px to the left side.
6.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a border radius of 5px to the top right and bottom left corners only.
7.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a background color of #DFE3E6.

The Navigation Menu
8.	Programmatically add the class “navigation” to each of the 5 navigation menu items.
9.	Select the navigation classes and apply a CSS solid, #929CA4, 1px border to them.
10.	Select the navigation classes and apply a color of #CC1C0D to them.
11.	Select the navigation classes and apply a padding of 3px to the top and bottom and 20px to the left side.
12.	Select the navigation classes and apply a background color of #DFE3E6.
Main Content
13.	Programmatically remove the vprospect, vconvert, and vretain classes from the <p> tags in the main <section> tag.
14.	Programmatically add the text “Chevy Dealers Association” after the word “President” in the client testimonials section. Make sure to programmatically add a line break after the word “President” so that the new text you’re adding is placed directly underneath.
15.	Programmatically wrap the testimonial verbiage with a <q> tag.
16.	Programmatically italicize the testimonial verbiage.
17.	Programmatically replace the bolded Vecta Corporation text in the opening paragraph with a hyperlinked version of the text. The link should go directly to http://www.vectacorp.com.
